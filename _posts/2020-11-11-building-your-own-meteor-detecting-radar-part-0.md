### Intro
Welcome to part `0` of an `N` part series on building your own meteor detecting radar from the ground up. As an RF novice, my primary motivation for pursuing this project was really just personal interest. However, I decided it would be fun to document my progress along the way in an effort to allow others to follow along.

At the end of this series you will have the knowledge to build a passive radar that is capable of detecting meteors in the upper atmosphere using off the shelf software defined radios and a home built antenna.

### The Game Plan
This initial post really isn't meant to cover any project specific material. Instead, let's set the stage for future topics so that you can have an idea on how these posts will be broken up.

------

**Part 1 - Theory / Background**
- High level overview of general project goals / capabilities 
- General radar concepts
- Bi-static / passive radar concepts
- Doppler effect
- Utilization of signal processing to extract data from radar
- Basic introduction to software defined radio

------

**Part 2 - Planning & Design**
- SDR requirements (multi-channel coherent receiver)
- Antenna requirements & design
- Computing / software requirements 
- Simulating antenna RF characteristics

---- 
**Part 3 - Antenna Fabrication**
- Building the antenna from hardware store parts
- Validating antenna performance

----

**And Beyond - TBD**
